# Space Bit
Procedurally generated planet saving, asteroid destroying game

## IDEAS

  - add shield for planets health
  - crystals to redo shields slowly
  - coins to purchase things
  - planet missiles


## NOTES
  - Originally this game was made to be a computer game. I made it a long time ago and it had some features that wouldn't work as a mobile game.

  - I decided to start over since I made Avalanche but I kept the graphics.

  - I am going to keep the GUI consistant throughout all of my games I make under KSquaredGames

  - The score will be based on what wave you make it to

## TASKS

### DONE:
  - [X] Make asteroids have random speed
  - [X] Create a wave system that gets adds more asteroids and increases their spawn rate each wave
  - [X] Make asteroids have random rotation


### NOT DONE:
  - [ ] Show the planets health as a bar at the top
  - [ ] When you tap, have an explosion be created
  - [ ] Have the asteroids explode into pieces when you tap on it (Purely cosmetic, the pieces wont hurt the planet)
  - [ ] Have large asteroids spawn in occasionally
  - [ ] Make the large asteroid break up into multiple small asteroid when blown up
  - [ ] When the planets health reaches 0 have the planet explode

### UNDECIDED:
