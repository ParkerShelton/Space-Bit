# Space Bit
Procedurally generated planet saving, asteroid destroying game

## IDEAS




## NOTES
  - Originally this game was made to be a computer game. I made it a long time ago and it had some features that wouldn't work as a mobile game.

  - I decided to start over since I made Avalanche but I kept the graphics.

  - I am going to keep the GUI consistant throughout all of my games I make under KSquaredGames

  - The score will be based on what wave you make it to
